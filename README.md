# Sneakeroo - Vue Quiz App

Sneakeroo is an engaging and interactive sneaker quiz application crafted using Vue.js. This project serves as a showcase of various Vue.js concepts and features that were learned and skillfully implemented throughout its development.

## Key Features and Concepts Implemented

**Two-Way Bindings**: Sneakeroo utilizes Vue.js's two-way data binding feature, allowing for seamless synchronization between the user interface and underlying data.

**State Management**: The app efficiently manages its state, ensuring a smooth user experience and accurate tracking of user interactions.

**Routing**: Vue Router is employed to handle navigation within the application, enabling users to seamlessly move between different sections and pages.

**Computed Values**: Computed properties are skillfully used to compute and display values based on changing data, enhancing the app's responsiveness and efficiency.

**Props and Emits**: Sneakeroo leverages Vue.js's prop and emit mechanisms for effective parent-child component communication, making the application architecture more modular and maintainable.

**And Much More**: Sneakeroo integrates a range of other Vue.js features and techniques that contribute to its overall functionality and user-friendliness.

This project is not only a fun and informative sneaker quiz but also a testament to my growing proficiency in Vue.js. Whether you're a sneaker enthusiast or a Vue.js developer looking to explore and learn from a practical example, Sneakeroo is an excellent showcase of both passions.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with Vue.js concepts, and, of course, enjoy testing your sneaker knowledge!
